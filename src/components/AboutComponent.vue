              about="Mangako About: Mangako was established by Deno Rautenbach. He sought to bridge the cultural gap between Japan and South Africa. Currently comprised of solely one team member. I would love recruit individuals with the same burning passion. South Africa is behind in a lot of ways, one of those ways is in the arts and culture scene.  How might I approach this problem? Incorporation of Japanese specific comic books known as 'Manga'.
              Manga are extremely popular in Japan and its reach has journeyed to the west. What my E-commerce site hopes to accomplish is to bring the brilliance and joy of Manga to South Africa by making it readily available. By doing this, I will curate a passion for cross cultural exchange through exciting tales of action, adventures, horror and a lot moreâ€¦ This will include digital as well as physical copies, like Amazon and Crunchyroll merged making it more streamlined for consumers to acquire specific manga all in one place instead of scouring the internet and filtering through sketchy websites. I chose this idea because I have a keen interest in Japan and anything related to Asian and or otherwise anything outside my own culture. This helps me and us grow and have a broader, open, perspective on things in our world"
